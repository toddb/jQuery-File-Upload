# jQuery File Upload Plugin - angularjs demo

This is a fork of [Demo File Upload](http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/)

I needed this as an experiment for others for use around angularjs.  Also other same [here for chunking](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/)

## Description
File Upload widget with multiple file selection, drag&amp;drop support, progress bars, validation and preview images, audio and video for jQuery.  
Supports cross-domain, chunked and resumable file uploads and client-side image resizing. Works with any server-side platform (PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java, Node.js, Go etc.) that supports standard HTML form file uploads.

## Setup
* `npm install -d`
* `grunt server` - to start the server on `localhost:8888`
* in a new terminal - `grunt` - serves the client and also opens a browser windw at `localhost:9001`

From there, you should be able to upload files

Look for files in `node_modules\blueimp-file-upload-node\public\files`
